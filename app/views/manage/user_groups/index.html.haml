        %p
          The
          %strong
            concept of groups has changed
          with version 5 of leihs.
          A group is now generally a subset of users which can be used in many contexts.
          What
          %strong
            used to refer to groups in older versions
          of leihs has now been more precicely renamed to
          %strong
            entitlement-groups.
