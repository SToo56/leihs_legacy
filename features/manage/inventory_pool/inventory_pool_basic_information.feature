Feature: Basic information for inventory pools

  As a person responsible for managing inventory pools
  I want to be able to change their settings and supply basic information
  So that each inventory pool has all the information and settings they
  need to work efficiently (e.g. opening hours, proper addresses, etc.)

  Scenario: Make basic settings
    Given I am Mike
    When I navigate to the inventory pool manage section
    Then I enter the inventory pool's basic settings as follows:
    | Name |
    | Short Name |
    | E-Mail |
    | Description |
    | Default Contract Note|
    | Print Contracts |
    And I make a note of which page I'm on
    And I save
    Then I see a confirmation that the information was saved
    And the settings are updated
    And I am still on the same page

    Then this configuration is saved
    When a user is suspended automatically due to late contracts
    Then they are suspended for this inventory pool
    And the reason for suspension is the one specified for this inventory pool
    When I disable "Automatic suspension"
    And I save
    Then "Automatic suspension" is disabled

  @rack
